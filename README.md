# 3D Wireless Sensor Network Node Placement Solution

This repository contains a Python implementation of an efficient node placement solution for 3D wireless sensor networks under Q-Coverage and Q-Connectivity constraints. The goal of this project is to ensure reliable and consistent coverage in wireless communication systems (Q-Coverage) while establishing and maintaining communication links between nodes in the network (Q-Connectivity).

## Features

- Efficient algorithm for node placement in 3D wireless sensor networks.
- Optimization for both Q-Coverage and Q-Connectivity constraints.
- Python codebase for easy understanding and modification.
- Detailed documentation explaining the algorithm and usage.

## Requirements

- Python
